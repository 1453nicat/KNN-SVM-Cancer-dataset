# KNN-SVM-Cancer-dataset

Project Title: K-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machines for Cancer Classification

Introduction

Cancer diagnosis is a critical task in the healthcare domain, where accurate and timely classification can save lives. This project aims to classify tumors as malignant (M) or benign (B) using machine learning algorithms. We will compare the performance of two algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The goal is to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each model and determine which performs better on the dataset.

Target Variable:

M for Malignant
B for Benign 


Model 1: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
KNN classifies a data point based on the majority class of its nearest neighbors.

Model 2: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
SVM finds an optimal hyperplane that separates the classes in feature space.

Evaluation Metrics:

1) Accuracy: Percentage of correctly classified instances.
2) Precision: Ability to avoid false positives.
3) Recall: Ability to capture true positives.
4) F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
5) Confusion Matrix: Visual representation of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

Libraries:
*Zipfile, Pandas, and NumPy*: for data manipulation
*Matplotlib and Seaborn*: for data visualization
*Sklearn*: for machine learning algorithms
